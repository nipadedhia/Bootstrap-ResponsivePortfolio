                            If you are looking for dramatic flowers, consider tropical hibiscus (Hibiscus
                            rosa-sinensis). The
                            trumpet-shaped flowers are 3 to 8 inches in diameter with dramatic protruding stamens.
                            Flowers are
                            produced constantly, but each blossom lasts only one day. These plants can grow as high as
                            15 feet
                            in good garden locations. In colder climates are often planted as container specimens that
                            are
                            either replanted annually or brought indoors during the cold months. If you are looking for

                        <h3> <strong> How to Grow Tropical Hibiscus </strong> </h3>

                        <p>In warmer climates, tropical hibiscus is grown as a perennial garden plant and is used as a
                            woody
                            shrub for hedges and screens. In colder climates, it is often planted in large containers as
                            a
                            patio or deck specimen. Tropical hibiscus can grow as high as 12 or 15 feet, but when
                            brought
                            indoors, it is usually trimmed back to 5 or 6 feet.

                            Tropical hibiscus is generally free of pests and diseases, but try to maintain consistent
                            soil
                            moisture and air temperature to help prevent yellow leaves. Spider mites and aphids are
                            common
                            insect pests. Plants can develop bacterial diseases due to transmission from insects, rain,
                            and
                            fog; symptoms are leaf wilt, dwarfing, stem rot, and distortion of leaves.
