            If you are looking for dramatic flowers, consider tropical hibiscus (Hibiscus
            rosa-sinensis). The
            trumpet-shaped flowers are 3 to 8 inches in diameter with dramatic protruding stamens.
            Flowers are
            produced constantly, but each blossom lasts only one day. These plants can grow as high as
            15 feet
            in good garden locations. In colder climates are often planted as container specimens that
            are
            either replanted annually or brought indoors during the cold months.

            <h1>How to Grow Tropical Hibiscus</h1>

            <p>In warmer climates, tropical hibiscus is grown as a perennial garden plant and is used as a
                woody
                shrub for hedges and screens. In colder climates, it is often planted in large containers as
                a
                patio or deck specimen. Tropical hibiscus can grow as high as 12 or 15 feet, but when
                brought
                indoors, it is usually trimmed back to 5 or 6 feet.

                Tropical hibiscus is generally free of pests and diseases, but try to maintain consistent
                soil
                moisture and air temperature to help prevent yellow leaves. Spider mites and aphids are
                common
                insect pests. Plants can develop bacterial diseases due to transmission from insects, rain,
                and
                fog; symptoms are leaf wilt, dwarfing, stem rot, and distortion of leaves.</p>
