## About Website:
I have created website named “Nature” using Bootstrap CSS Framework to create mobile responsive portfolio. I have used contents from the website “https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/ornamental/flowers/hibiscus/how-to-care-for-hibiscus-plants.htm” and reference is added to the website on About page. 

## index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html files:
** Navbar is consistent on each page, and it contains About, Portfolio and Contact pages. Clicking on link, user is navigated to that specific page.
** Clicking on “Nature” from any page, navigates to About (Home) page. 
** Used Semantic HTML structure
•	Used Bootstrap grid system (container, rows and columns)
•	Used class=”img-fluid” to make images responsive.
•	Used validation service website “Validator.w3.org” to validate each page.
•	Using Bootstrap, made footer sticky 
•	Used sub-rows and columns on portfolio page
•	Used alt tag for images
•	Used class=”form-group” and class=”form-control” on Contact page for form
