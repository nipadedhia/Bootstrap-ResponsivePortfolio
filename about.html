                    If you are looking for dramatic flowers, consider tropical hibiscus (Hibiscus
                    rosa-sinensis). The
                    trumpet-shaped flowers are 3 to 8 inches in diameter with dramatic protruding stamens.
                    Flowers are
                    produced constantly, but each blossom lasts only one day. These plants can grow as high as
                    15 feet
                    in good garden locations. In colder climates are often planted as container specimens that
                    are
                    either replanted annually or brought indoors during the cold months.

                    <h3> <strong> How to Grow Tropical Hibiscus </strong> </h3>

                    <p>In warmer climates, tropical hibiscus is grown as a perennial garden plant and is used as a
                        woody
                        shrub for hedges and screens. In colder climates, it is often planted in large containers as
                        a
                        patio or deck specimen. Tropical hibiscus can grow as high as 12 or 15 feet, but when
                        brought
                        indoors, it is usually trimmed back to 5 or 6 feet.

                        Tropical hibiscus is generally free of pests and diseases, but try to maintain consistent
                        soil
                        moisture and air temperature to help prevent yellow leaves. Spider mites and aphids are
                        common
                        insect pests. Plants can develop bacterial diseases due to transmission from insects, rain,
                        and
                        fog; symptoms are leaf wilt, dwarfing, stem rot, and distortion of leaves.</p>
